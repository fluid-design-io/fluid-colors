## 🌈 What is Fluid Color Palettes?

Welcome to Fluid Color Palettes, where beautiful color palettes meet dynamic functionality! This project powers a Figma plugin that brings fully dynamic variables to your design process. But that's not all! You can also use this tool as a standalone website, offering a modern and minimal UI to visualize and interact with your chosen colors.
